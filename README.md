# Demo

[demo](https://svelte-tetris-phi.vercel.app)

Basic implementation of Tetris... currently no levels or speed progression

# TODO

- Piece movement doesn't move smoothly, could be due to the style updating at a slight delay.

- Swipe hold needs to have a smoother movement, possible delay after the first two movements and holding for +3 sec will drag it to the end.

- Add sounds on movement, rotation, and block break
