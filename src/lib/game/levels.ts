// In A-Type, the level advances for every 10 lines cleared.
// Each successive level increases the points scored by line
// clears and changes the colors of the game pieces.[2] All
// levels from 1 to 10 increase the game speed. After level 10, 
// the game speed only increases on levels 13, 16, 19, and 29,[b]
// at which point the speed no longer increases. On level 29, pieces 
// fall at 1 grid cell every frame, which is too fast for almost
//  all players, and it is thus called the "kill screen"
